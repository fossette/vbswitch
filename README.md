# vbswitch

**vbswitch** is a tool to easily switch between different `.vdi` files
in the same directory.  A `.vdi` file is a VitualBox virtual disk.
Normally, a virtual disk should be cloned so both the original and
the clone can co-exist in the same VirtualBox host.  In this case,
the only difference is their internal Serial Disk ID which are
always distinct so VirtualBox can know which disk is which.  The
original and the clone could even be assigned to the same virtual
machine if needed.

However, there are cases where one just wishes to perform some tests
and discard the results (or keep them for good if they are positive).
A way to do that is to duplicate the `.vdi` file, rename it to a
significant name that perhaps include the date.  No need to change
the virtual machine's configuration options.  When the test is over,
either delete the duplicate `.vdi` file if the current state is wanted,
or delete the current `.vdi` file, and rename the duplicate file to the
original `.vdi` filename.

All this renaming can be a source of errors, and perhaps lost of data.
This is where **vbswitch** becomes handy.  It performs all the file
renaming automatically and quickly.

## Getting started with vbswitch

Suppose you have an Ubuntu 14.04 LTS guest virtual machine, and it's
virtual disk is `ubuntu14.vdi`.  In this example,  `ubuntu14` is your
base name.  Do the following steps:

1. Create an empty file called `ubuntu14-original.vbswitch`  This file tells **vbswitch** that `ubuntu14.vdi` is now your original `.vdi` file.
2. Create as many `.vdi` duplicates as you require, and identify them clearly.  For example, you can have `ubuntu14-kerneltest.vdi` and `ubuntu14-drivertest.vdi`

The only thing to make sure is that all files must share the same
base name for **vbswitch** to work.

**WARNING**: The virtual machine of the disks you wish to switch
MUST NOT RUN.  I never tried it, but no doubt in my mind that it's
very damaging.

To make the actual switch, you can run **vbswitch** directly in the
virtual machine folder.  You can also run **vbswitch** from anywhere,
but specify the virtual machine folder path as the first argument
of **vbswitch**.  I personally do this in a desktop menu shortcut.
It's quick and easy.

## How to build and install vbswitch

1. Download the source files and store them in a directory
2. Go to that directory in a terminal window
3. To built the executable file, type `make`
4. To install the executable file, type `make install` as a superuser.  The `Makefile` will copy the executable file into the `/usr/bin` directory.  If you want it elsewhere, feel free to copy it by hand instead.

## Troubleshooting

_**vbswitch: Command not found.**_  
**vbswitch** is not found in your executables' path.  Try `make install`
as a superuser.

_**ERROR: No .vbswitch reference file found.**_  
Find out what is your `.vdi` file, and where it's located.  We'll
call it `<base-name>.vdi` where `<base-name>` is your file base name.
Create a new empty file called `<base-name>-original.vbswitch`
That's all there is to it.

_**ERROR: At least two .vdi files are required to move on.**_  
Never easy, right?  Try `cp <base-name>.vdi <base-name>-mytest.vdi`.

## Version history

## Compatibility

**vbswitch** has been developed and tested under FreeBSD 10.1.
It should be compatible with other systems because only standard
libraries have been used.
